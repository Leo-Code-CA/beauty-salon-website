# Full Stack Beauty Salon Website

This is a full stack beauty salon website. I started this project on October, 23 2023. It is without any doubt the biggest and most complex code project I've ever started so far.

## Overview

### The project

#### The concept

This project means a lot to me as it's not only a project I've been doing to improve my coding skills but also a project that is destined to, one day, be the website of an actual beauty salon named "Institut For You", owned by my mother-in-law.

For now, she has a basic WordPress powered website with a theme installed by my partner a few years ago. It's functional but it starts to be outdated and I definitely would love to help her out by coding her a brand new, improved, totally unique and customized depending on her needs, website.

Furthermore, my mother-in-law is not comfortable with technology in general and struggles every single time she wants to update, add or delete some information on her website, even with the WordPress interface. To solve this problem I figured out that the best thing would probably be to let her modify mostly the services she offers (prices, description, adding a new service) in an easy, step-by-step, guided way.

What I want to create is probably a kind of CMS, simplified and dedicated to a single user. My goal is to give her access to an admin page on her website where she can login and make those CRUD operations in a "computer novice" way, without spending hours on it. 

As soon as I learnt HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics, I was determined to start working on that project. It's a surprise so my mother-in-law doesn't know anything about it, even 5 months after. I definitely hope I'll be able to finish it, sooner or later, to finally reveal it to her and see what she thinks about it! 

Most of the content on the website is in French as my mother's in-laws salon is located in France and is aiming to be read mostly by french customers. However, all the code is in English so it shouldn't be a big problem for developers who don't speak French.
